# COVID

**This policy is a living document, and subject to refinement and expansion in the future. Last updated May 16, 2024.**

Everyone participating in XOXO is required to agree to the following COVID Policy. This includes all attendees, speakers, performers, patrons (sponsors), volunteers, and staff.

Anyone who violates this COVID Policy may be removed from the event at the discretion of the XOXO organizers.

## About This Policy

We want to make sure that as many people as possible can safely attend the final in-person XOXO. We ask that everyone agree to some basic, commonsense protections that will make things safer for everyone.

However, we appreciate this policy isn’t, won’t be, and can’t be perfect. We understand people are going to travel, eat meals, and socialize together unmasked and in high risk settings around XOXO. This isn’t about coming up with a flawless system, but about using best practices that have worked to reduce spread through the pandemic, and doing what we can to collectively take care of each other.

Please work with us to abide by these simple rules, so we can all get excited about seeing each other in-person again.

## Masking

All XOXO participants are required to wear a high-quality mask at all times while inside Washington High (including Revolution Hall, Show Bar, and all common areas inside the venue), the reserved area for Park Pass holders in the tent, as well as at any festival event on our schedule where masks are required.

Each event on our festival schedule will include details for mask requirements, capacity, and availability of outdoor seating. Speakers and performers will not be required to wear masks on stage.

Masks should be N95, KN95, or KF94 masks, cover the nose and mouth completely, and worn properly throughout the event. Disposable “paper” surgical masks and cloth masks are not allowed.

## Testing

Attendees are asked to monitor their health leading up to and during the conference. Under no circumstances should you attend XOXO if you test positive for COVID, or have any other reason to believe you may be unwell.

We encourage you to test before traveling to Portland and to wear a high-quality mask while traveling. If you have the means, we recommend taking a COVID test before the event each day.

## Pass Types

This year, we’re providing [two pass options](/guide/passes), allowing you to decide where you sit based on your personal risk profile.

> **Theater Pass** holders have access to seating inside our main venue, Revolution Hall. Attendees are required to wear a high-quality mask at all times while inside the venue.
> 
> **Park Pass** holders will have access to reserved seating in the tent at Washington High Park, a large, shaded, well-ventilated space for viewing the simulcast of our main stage programming. Park Pass holders are required to wear a high-quality mask at all times while in the reserved seating area.

We will have reserved seating exclusively for Park Pass holders in the front of the tent in the park, with additional seating in back for any attendee to use. In Revolution Hall, however, capacity is more limited and reserved solely for Theater Pass holders.
